# Applicativo_Turismo

This example software simulates the process of buying a tourist ticket, offered with some discount if it includes many places.
The software automatically books a place in an available time period, and suggests related attractions considering the
distance among the user location and the various places. The system also detects if there are no time period available, canceling
the ticket and refunding the user.

The entry point for executing this software is in the ApplicativoTurismo Java class.
